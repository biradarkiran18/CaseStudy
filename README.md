# Comprehensive Documentation for Streamlit-Based Marketing Content Generator with LangChain

This documentation outlines the setup, usage, and deployment of a Streamlit-based application that generates marketing content or answers user queries using LangChain. The application allows customization of response "voice" (using Stewie Griffin's character), emotion, and length, providing flexibility in response generation. It uses a customizable prompt template, an LLM (like Ollama's `llama3`), and Streamlit for the interactive user interface.

## Overview
The Streamlit-based application allows users to enter a search term and generate marketing content or query responses. It uses a LangChain prompt template where Stewie Griffin's character provides a unique "voice" and emotional tone to the responses. Additional parameters like emotion and length can be used to tailor the response to specific requirements.

## Authentication
The code snippet uses environment variables for LangChain tracing and other configurations. To set up authentication and environment variables:

- **Create a `.env` File**: In the root of your project directory, create a `.env` file.
- **Add Environment Variables**: Include the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file:
  ```dotenv
  LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here
  ```
- **Load Environment Variables**: Use `dotenv` to load the environment variables at runtime:
  ```python
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  ```

## Installation
To set up the environment and install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended but optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain-openai langchain-core langchain-community dotenv
   ```

## Input Processing
The Streamlit-based application processes user input in the following ways:

- **User Interface**:
   - The Streamlit UI includes a title and a text input field to capture the user's search term or question.
   - The input text is processed and used to generate a response through the LangChain processing chain.

- **Additional Parameters**:
   - **Format**: Determines how the response is structured (e.g., plain text, bullet points, summary).
   - **Emotion**: Specifies the emotional tone for the response.
   - **Length**: Defines the desired length of the response (short, medium, long).

## Response Generation
The response is generated through a customizable LangChain prompt template and an LLM. Here's how it works:

1. **Prompt Template**:
   - The prompt template is defined with a conversational structure, including a "system" message that sets the voice and tone (Stewie Griffin in this case) and a "user" message with placeholders for the question.

2. **LLM Selection**:
   - The code uses Ollama's `llama3` model for text generation. This can be customized based on the desired LLM.

3. **Output Parsing**:
   - The `StrOutputParser` extracts the text response from the LLM's output, providing a clean and usable response.

4. **Chain Execution**:
   - The response is generated by invoking the LangChain chain, which combines the prompt template, LLM, and output parser.

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy and run the Streamlit-based application, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Streamlit Server**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your script is located.
   - Start Streamlit with:
     ```bash
     streamlit run your_script_name.py
     ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - By default, Streamlit runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8501`. Open a web browser and go to this address to interact with your application.

3. **Interacting with the Application**:
   - Use the text input field to enter a query or search term. The application should generate a response based on the prompt template and parameters.

## Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and their potential solutions:

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure environment variables are correctly loaded and the API key is valid.
- **Package Installation Issues**: Verify that all required packages are installed.
- **Streamlit Errors**: Check Streamlit's console output for error messages and correct them accordingly.
- **LLM Errors**: Ensure the LLM (like Ollama) is running and properly configured.
